we will create 1 database for each venue
in each database there will be:
	1 table for devices to be checked (MAC_ID list)
	1 table for device RSSIs from routers (router primary key), n columns for RSSIs (n = number of devices on other table, column name = MAC_ID of devices)
a website will be available to update devices list, also an API for android application to add and remove devices from database
openwrt will ssh the tcpdump (timestamp + MAC_ID + RSSI) information to server
server will process the information and update the database
	server will check the device list
	server will collect RSSI information for all devices in the list for the last 10 seconds and update the latest RSSI for each on database
	server will repeat this process for all routers
then another process running in the server will continuously check the database and calculate the devices' location (trilateration + fingerprinting)

topics to be discussed:
	- how to process data in real time? (which language?)
	- mysql multithreading (which engine? or which database?)
		- redis
	- processing power, accuracy and latency (table lookups)
